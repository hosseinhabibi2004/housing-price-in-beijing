## Preprocessing

First, we preprocessed the existing dataset. We removed unnecessary data. Then we imputed or deleted missing data. After that, we formatted the data into appropriate types. Finally, we removed outliers from the dataset. After cleaning the data, we added new information to the dataset that would be useful in the analysis phase using other data. The final processed dataset is saved in the file [housing-data-proccessed.csv](data/proccessed/housing-data-proccessed.csv).


## Analysis

First, we obtained general information from the dataset using bar charts. After that, we examined the impact of various factors on prices using different charts. In the next step, we displayed the distribution of houses based on price on the city map. Additionally, we categorized the houses based on their districts and obtained general information for each district. Finally, we plotted and examined various time-series charts, such as price changes over time.
